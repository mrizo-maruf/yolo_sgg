### Scene Graph Merging Algorithm

The system builds a **persistent scene graph** across multiple frames by merging frame-by-frame observations. This allows tracking objects and their relationships over time as the camera moves through the scene.

#### How It Works

**1. Node Matching**
- First, the algorithm matches objects between the current frame and the persistent graph using **tracking IDs** from YOLO (most reliable method)
- For objects without reliable IDs, it falls back to **spatial matching** using 3D position and bounding box overlap
- Objects that can't be matched are added as new nodes

**2. Node Updates**
- Matched nodes get updated with the latest 3D position, point cloud, and bounding box information
- This keeps the graph synchronized with the most recent observations

**3. Edge Handling: Egocentric vs Allocentric**

The algorithm treats two types of spatial relationships differently:

- **Egocentric relationships** (camera-dependent): proximity, "to the left/right", directional relations
  - These change as the camera moves
  - Old egocentric edges are removed and replaced with current frame observations
  
- **Allocentric relationships** (camera-independent): support, embedded, hanging, aligned
  - These are physical relationships that don't depend on camera viewpoint
  - Once detected, they persist across frames unless contradicted by new evidence
  - Conflicting allocentric relationships (e.g., object can't be both ON and INSIDE another) are resolved by keeping the newest observation

**4. Conflict Resolution**
- If a new observation contradicts an existing allocentric relationship, the old edge is removed
- Special handling for support relationships: removing a support edge also removes the corresponding opposite-support edge
